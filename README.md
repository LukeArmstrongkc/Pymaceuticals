# Pymaceuticals

The purpose of this project was to use Python to observe cancer drugs to see which ones had a positive or negative effect, and which ones were placebos.

# Observable Trends
* Of the four drug variables observed in this exercise, only Capomulin hade any noticeable impact on reducing tumor mass.
However, none of the variables completely stopped the spread of metastatic sites.

* In terms of surviving the treatments, Capomulin was clearly the safest choice, while Infubinol was actually more deadly than just using a placebo.
